# Camille Offline AI Assistant

Welcome to Camille Offline, a Python-based AI assistant that enables voice conversations using local Large Language Models (LLMs). This project leverages Whisper for speech-to-text, LM Studio for local LLM inference, and Porcupine for wake-word detection, all while prioritizing privacy and accessibility. Camille Offline is designed to provide a seamless, interactive voice-based AI experience entirely on your local machine.

## Key Features

- **Privacy-First**: All processing happens locallyâ€”no data is sent to external servers.
- **Voice Interaction**: Speak naturally to interact with the AI using wake-word detection and speech-to-text.
- **Customizable**: Easily configure the AI's name, voice, and behavior to suit your preferences.
- **Offline Capable**: Runs entirely on your machine, intended to prevent them from listening to you.


## Getting Started

This guide will walk you through setting up and running Camille Offline on your local machine. Follow the steps below to prepare your environment, install dependencies, and start using the assistant.

### Setting Up Your Python Environment

1. **Create a Conda Environment**:
   Open a terminal and create a new Conda environment with Python 3.9:
   ```
   conda create -n camille-env python=3.9.18
   ```
   Replace `camille-env` with a name of your choice.

2. **Activate the Environment**:
   Activate the newly created environment:
   ```
   conda activate camille-env
   ```

3. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the Camille Offline repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/cfpg/Camille-Offline
   cd Camille-Offline
   ```

4. **Install Required Packages**:
   Install the necessary Python packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuring LM Studio

1. **Download a Model**:
   Open LM Studio and download a compatible LLM model (e.g., `llama-3.2-3b-instruct`).

2. **Start the Local Inference Server**:
   In LM Studio, navigate to the "Local Server" tab and start the server. Ensure it is running on `http://localhost:1234`.

### Running Camille Offline

1. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add your Picovoice access key:
   ```
   PICOVOICE_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key_here
   ```
   Replace `your_access_key_here` with your actual Picovoice access key.

2. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the main script to start Camille Offline:
   ```
   python speak.py
   ```

3. **Interact with Camille**:
   - Use the wake phrase **"Hey Camille"** to activate the assistant.
   - Speak your command after the wake phrase is detected.
   - Camille will process your request and respond via text-to-speech.

## Troubleshooting

- **LM Studio Compatibility**: If the provided setup doesn't work for your system, refer to the [LM Studio documentation](https://lmstudio.ai/docs) for alternative configurations.
- **Dependency Issues**: Regularly update the `requirements.txt` file to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of dependencies.
- **Need Help?**: This project was initially developed with the help of ChatGPT. If you encounter issues, consider consulting GPT-based tools for troubleshooting and solutions.

## Customization

- **Change the Wake Phrase**: Replace the `hey-camille.ppn` file in the project directory with a custom wake-word model from [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/).
- **Modify the AI's Behavior**: Edit the system prompt in the `process_input` function in `speak.py` to customize the AI's responses.
- **Adjust Audio Settings**: Modify the `RATE`, `CHUNK`, and `FORMAT` variables in `speak.py` to optimize audio recording for your environment.
